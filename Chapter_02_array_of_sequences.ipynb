    "Understanding the variety of sequences available in Python saves us from reinventingthe wheel, and their common interface inspires us to create APIs that properly supportand leverage existing and future sequence types.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Group the following sequence types from the Python standard library as either a container sequence or flat sequence and explain the difference between each group.\n",

    "    `bytes`, `str`, `list`, `deque`, `array`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`, `tuple`\n",

Thus, flat sequences are more compact, but they arelimited to holding primitive values like characters, bytes, and numbers.*\n",
